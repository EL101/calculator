# calculator

A simple calculator with all four basic math operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide), along with the percent and negation buttons. 

Use the AC button to clear everything, and the DEL button to delete the last digit of your current number. The DEL button cannot delete an operator though.

Keyboard use is supported! (besides the +/- button)
